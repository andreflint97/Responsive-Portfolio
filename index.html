        <p>Hello! I am 21 years old, I have lived in downtown cleveland for 4 years. I am orginally from Sheffield,Ohio and went to Brookside High School. Upon graduating in 2015, I started attending Cleveland State working towards a marketing degree.</p>
        <p>My interests include sports, music, fashion and film. I currently work for the Cleveland Cavaliers, I have worked there for 4 years as well and I own a championship ring from 2016. My interest in tech partially is because of my job with the Cavs. All the odds and ends of websites, POS systems, jumbotrons etc. really interested me. Besides that I taught myself HTML & CSS and learned some other points from a close friend of mine in the field. I hope to extend my knowledge and come out of this program with a career in the tech field.I am looking forward to learning more every class!</p>
